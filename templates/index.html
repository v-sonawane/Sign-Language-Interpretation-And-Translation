            <h1 class="Question1">What is UNITE MOJO</h1>
            <p class="answer">UNITE MOJO is a website that is made for sign language detection. Communication has been a core part of the human development since the dawn of human civilization. Initail communication was in the form of paintings and sketches on the walls of caves by the cavemen. Then a big advancement came to communication techniques when they started using sign language. Then more advancements came in the form of verbal communication, Languages were developed and the human race found a good way to communicate with each other. But people who are deaf and dumb have to rely on sign language for communication and sometimes the normal people are nit able to understand them. So to solve that issue UNITE MOJO can be used. With the help of deep learning and Computer Vision it is UNITE MOJO is able to capture the sign and then give the english equiavlent of that sign which would be a very helpful initiative for the deaf and dumb people beacuse they would be able to express themselves easily.</p>
